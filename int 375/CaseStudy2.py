'''A smart city initiative installs IoT sensors on roads to monitor traffic congestion. The sensor data is stored 
in a 2D NumPy array, where each row represents a different road, and each column represents hourly 
traffic counts.
Problem Statement:
Using NumPy, analyze traffic patterns by performing the following operations:
1. Create a 2D NumPy array to store traffic data.
2. Find the average vehicle count per road over the day.
3. Identify roads with peak congestion periods (highest values).
4. Detect roads with traffic exceeding a critical congestion threshold.
